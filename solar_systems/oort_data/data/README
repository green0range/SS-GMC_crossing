Results are all folded in the data/ directory. Recall we ran
four jobs which differed in the way (i) how fast planets
migrated, and (ii) how we statistically treated stellar encounters.
Overall, they provide equivalent results for our purposes.
The properties of the early planet migrations are important 
for some details of Kuiper belt orbital architecture, but
quite less so for the Oort cloud structure. Also our stellar
encounter models were similar enough that we did not see
significant differences among the jobs. All this is just to 
explain, that I always give four variants of results labeled with

*_case?_ver?0

notation. Case1 or case2 are the two variants of planet
migration (case1 means slower migration and case2 faster 
migration); ver10 and ver20 are the two variants of stellar
encounter models. I'd suggest to use

*_case1_ver10

files at the moment (if you'd like to test robustness of the
results, use also the other files).

Next, I though it might be useful to provide data at few 
different epochs. We ran our jobs for 4.5 Gyr and I give
here planets + planetesimal/comet orbits at

1.5 Gyr, 2.5 Gyr, 3.5 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr
(after the origin of the Solar system).

This does not include information about early stages of the
Oort cloud filling -- the cloud is initially formed after
~ 0.5 Gyr and since then slowly erodes by the mutual effects
of galactic tides and stellar encounters. However, there
are subtleties: for instance the inner Oort cloud fills the
last and there are significant differences between 1.5 and
4.5 Gyr epochs if you look at planetesimal orbits with
semimajor axes between 2000-7000 au (say). This is because the
inner cloud is (in our model, where we do not include
effects of the solar birth cluster or possible strong radial
outward migration in the Galaxy) build by galactic tides only,
whose periods become very long at few thousand au helicentric
distance.

So the data/ directory is first brached into four subdirectories

data_at_1.5Gy/
data_at_2.5Gy/
data_at_3.5Gy/
data_at_4.5Gy/

depending at what epoch of our simulations the data are provided.

Each of them contains the following files

 aeii.data_case1_ver10
 aeii.data_case1_ver20
 aeii.data_case2_ver10
 aeii.data_case2_ver20

 pl.data_case1_ver10
 pl.data_case1_ver20
 pl.data_case2_ver10
 pl.data_case2_ver20

 tp.data_case1_ver10
 tp.data_case1_ver20
 tp.data_case2_ver10
 tp.data_case2_ver20

with the following meaning:

- pl.data_*

  contain information about planets and the Sun in swift format

  5           <-- number of massive bodies (Sun + 4 giant planets)
  39.477...   <-- GM_Sun in au and yr units
  0 0 0       <-- solar heliocentric position and velocity
  0 0 0       

  followed with information about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
  in the form

  GM_planet  R_planet   <-- R=radius, again in au and yr units
  x y z                 <-- heliocentric position in au
  vx vy vz              <-- heliocentric velocity in au/yr

- tp.data_*

  contain basically heliocentric positions and velocities of
  massless bodies (planetesimals/comets/... or how you want to call
  them), each preceded with number of the body, i.e.

  1
  x y z        <-- heliocentric position in au of the first body
  vx vy vz     <-- heliocentric velocity in au/yr of the first body
  2
  x y z        <-- heliocentric position in au of the second body
  vx vy vz     <-- heliocentric velocity in au/yr of the second body
  ...

- aeii.data_*

  provide solar system barycentric orbital elements for particles in
  tp.data_* files (with the barycenter computed with pl.data_* files);
  the columns are simply

  a_bary (au)  e   I_1 (deg)   I_2 (deg)

  only bodies with eccentricity e<1 are listed, I_1 is the inclination
  wrt the Solar system Laplacian plane and I_2 is the inclination with
  respect the galactic plane; a_bary is the barycentric semimajor axis.

These last files might be handy when you'd like to check the orbital
architecture of the particles. This is dominated in number by objects
in the Oort cloud, but you may also see the scattering disk, resonant
populations (in exterior resonances with Neptune) etc.

The relative number of objects in different populations should be 
correct (i.e. set by the assumed model), but the absolute number is 
obviously tied to the fact that our simulations had initially 10^6 
planetesimals in a trans-Neptunian massive disk in between ~23 au and 30 au. 
We have then a rough calibration to sizes from implantantion simulations to
heliocentrically closer populations like Jupiter Trojans or Centaurs.
Very roughly, we believe there were ~ 6 x 10^9 planetesimals with
D > 10 km in the disk as an example.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rem. just in case it is useful: we used a quadrupole approximation
of the galactic tidal field in the heliocentric frame, e.g. eq. (1)
in

https://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/davok/papers/LPC_AJ2019.pdf

with the parameters mentioned in the text. We assume a coordinate
system in which the nodal line of the galactic plane is along the
x-axis of the Solar system (Laplacian) plane; the direction to
the galactic center was at the x-axis at the time origin of
of simulations and the inclination of the galactic plane to the
Solar sytem invariable plane is 60.2 deg. I may also send the
subroutine if you want.

In principle, the quadrupole approximation may not be accurate enough
say beyond 50000 au helicentric distance, since higher multipoles
may be important for high-accuracy orbital computations. Hopefully
this is negligible when dealing with a statistical ensemble of comets
(i.e., the whole cloud), but I actually never tested this issue.
